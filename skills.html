									<p>Hi, my name is Quinton McNamee. I am a Full-Stack Web Developer orginally from Boston, MA but am now in the Greater Los Angeles Area. I am currently enrolled at Lambda School* and I am expected to graduate in April, 2020.</p>

									<p>*Lambda School is a 9-12 month Computer Science & Software Engineering academy based in San Francisco that provides a hands-on curriculum with a focus on Computer Science and Full-Stack Web Development. Some of my accomplishments at Lambda School were:</p>

									<ul>
										<li>Passing ALL sprint challenges. Sprint challenges are the the weekly tests that Lambda School students MUST pass in order to move on to the next week of instruction.</li>
										<li>Leading 3 other students on the back-end team during an 8-week long project where we collaborated with 10+ other students from other Lambda School tracks. These other tracks were UX Design and Data Science. Our task was to build a website from scratch that improves upon standard email clients.</li>
									</ul>

									<p>Before Lambda School I was enrolled at Concordia University in Montreal as a Computer Engineering major. While at Concordia I took a wide range of classes including a Programming Methodology classes which was based in the C++ programming language. In addition, I taught myself HTML and CSS over the course of 3 months using online resources including several courses I bought on Udemy.com. These turned out to be invaluable skills when I was accepted to Lambda School!</p>
