								<h4>Tech Stack: Node.js, Express.js, OAuth 2, Gmail API</h4>
								<p>This was an 8-week long project that I worked on with my fellow classmates at Lambda School. In collaboration with UX Design students, Data Science students, and fellow Web Development students, our goal was to create a better email client. We accomplished this by making it more people oriented and by displaying more relevant labels to the user. I lead the back-end team and our task was to create a line of communication between the front-end team, the data science team, and the gmail API. This was done using Node.js. During this project my team and I utilized Agile Software Development practices including Trello, Product Vision Documents, and Release Canvases.</p>

								<h4>Tech Stack: Node.js, Express.js, SQL, Jest</h4>
								<p>One of the projects I had the most fun working on. Our task for this 5-day project was to build a calculator for the popular mobile game Pokemon Go. The calculator determines whether or not you should catch the encountered Pokemon. Along with 2 other team members, I built the front-end using React.js. All of the calculations for determining the worth of each Pokemon was handled by my team on the front-end while the signup, login, and database were handled by 2 other teams.</p>

								<h4>Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React</h4>
								<p>I really liked this project because it was for such a good cause. Our task for this 5-day project was to build a calendar for a non-profit organization in North End, Detroit. I worked solo on the backend for this project. I handled the login, signup, and the database (all the data being displayed on the page). The tech stacks I used were Node.js, SQLite3, and Knex.js</p>

								<h4>Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript</h4>
								<p>This was an interesting project. I had a family friend who needed a website built for their personal bookkeeping business. They had already started throwing something together using GoDaddy, however, they weren't sure what to do next. Over the next 2 days I helped them buy a domain name, edit the layout based on their needs, add navigation, add multiple pages, add their own information, text, and images, as well as add functionality to their contact page.</p>
